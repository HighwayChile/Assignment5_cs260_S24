# Assignment5_cs260_S24  
Hello, welcome to readme for an auto sorting list!  

# Locations:  
the inserting begins at line 35 of auto_sort.cpp  
The efficient linear search begins on line 84 of auto_sort.cpp  

# Notes  
Okay, I am still terrible at following instructions. What we want is an auto-sorting list! I can still use large parts of 
my design, but I need to remove some aspects, and have already implemented others. Need to search for element most of all.  

I got it all running the way I want, and I am seeing how much the precious assignment really prepared me for this.  

Note to Joseph Jess: Use option 5 on the main menu to run the test module.   


# Instructions  
    Follow along with the in-class exercise on this, do your best to get it working, and turn in what you come up with here!  

    Be sure to include at least one test for each function or piece of functionality that should verify that your code is working! No slacking smile, you should start writing some tests before you write your implementations (just spend a few minutes thinking about the design and then write a few tests using natural language (English is preferred for me to be able to read it smile ))    

    Create an array-based list or a linked-list (and a bonus for attempting both) that:  

        automatically inserts values in the correct position based on some order of sorting (perhaps ascending integers or lexicographical sorting of words)  

        efficiently searches for elements (likely binary search for the array list, but what about the linked-list?)  

    Make a chart to compare the algorithmic complexity (use Big-O notation) of your insert, remove, and search algorithms you used for your structures  

    Once you have implemented and tested your code, add to the README file what line(s) of code or inputs and outputs show your work meeting each of the above requirements (or better, include a small screen snip of where it meets the requirement!).  

Note: This assignment is to get you to think about and practice with structures that have automatically enforced properties (perhaps auto sorted, since we know sorting can be expensive... and how these might be able to be spread out over time)
